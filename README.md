# Eren-Bot
My friends and I always had these bots in our discord that has many different commands. Some that we use a lot, and some that we never touch and are pointless. Marlon and I thought it would be cool for us to have a bot that has commands that we can actually use every single day. We also always wondered what it takes to create a discord bot and if its actually worth spending time to create.

Our Eren discord bot has many different commands in order to achieve certain things. For example if the user inputs !play [YouTube URL], the bot would join the call and start playing the music. If you would like to pause the sound you can just input the !pause command and use !resume to continue afterwards. Another command would be the Covid-19 tracker. Covid-19 is very prevalent in our lives for the past year and a half and we often dont realize how bad it is until we see the numbers. By inputting the command !activeCases, we are able to see active cases in Ontario. We have more commands such as !dog which gives us a fact, !meme which uploads a meme png, !anime which outputs a random anime and its rating, as well as 4 star wars commands which outputs a quote from one of the characters chosen (!obiwan, !yoda, !darthvader, and !palpatine)

In order to run this program on your computer, you will need to have ffmpeg installed to your system as well as youtube DL
